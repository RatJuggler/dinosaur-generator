# dinosaur-generator

My version of the dinosaur name generator featured in a number of blogs and Kaggle kernels (not an exhaustive 
list):

* [Character level language model - Dinosaurus land](https://datascience-enthusiast.com/DL/Dinosaurus_Island_Character_level_language_model.html)
* [Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Dinosaurs](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-recurrent-neural-networks-rnn-with-dinosaurs-790e74e3e6f6)
* [Kaggle - Dinosaur Island](https://www.kaggle.com/swimmingwhale/dinosaur-island/kernels)

It uses a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), which I don't fully understand yet but I'm 
working on it. Helpful articles:
